\chapter{Conclusion}

The development of the electronic stethoscope demonstrates the integration of electronics, software, and medical knowledge to create a modern diagnostic tool. With its ability to capture, process, and analyze body sounds, this device provides a valuable addition to healthcare diagnostics. Further improvements in signal processing and hardware miniaturization could make this tool indispensable for clinicians.

This project demonstrated how easy to design a digital stethoscope using off-the-shelf components. The device was able to capture and process body sounds, and the results were displayed on a computer screen. With further development, the device could be used for real-time diagnosis and monitoring of patients.
