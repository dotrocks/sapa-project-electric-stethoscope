\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
The stethoscope, a critical tool in medical diagnostics for nearly two centuries, has been a staple in physiciansâ€™ practices worldwide. With technological advancements, digital stethoscopes have emerged as modern alternatives, offering enhanced auscultation capabilities. These devices are cost-effective easy to use and capable of capturing both normal and abnormal breath sounds with high accuracy. This project aims to develop an electronic stethoscope system capable of acquiring and processing acoustic signals from various human body parts.

\section{Objective}
The primary goal is to design an electronic stethoscope system that acquires acoustic body sounds, converts them into digital signals, and transmits them to a computer for real-time monitoring and analysis. The system will include hardware and software components for:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Signal acquisition
	\item Amplification and filtering
	\item Digital conversion and transmission
	\item Real-time tracking via a graphical user interface (GUI)
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The project involves designing custom amplification and filtering circuits without using commercial modules.
	\item Arduino will handle digital conversion and data transmission.
	\item Python will be used for GUI development, ensuring smooth signal monitoring and analysis.
\end{itemize}
